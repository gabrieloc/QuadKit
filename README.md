**A simple set of interfaces for communicating with your Wi-Fi enabled quadcopter**.

QuadKit powers [SCARAB](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scarab-rc-controller-for-quadcopters/id1205279859), an RC controller for iOS. Read about the making of QuadKit: [Building a Quadcopter Controller for iOS and Open-Sourcing the Internals](https://medium.com/@_gabrieloc/building-a-quadcopter-controller-for-ios-and-open-sourcing-the-internals-3bbc7f526ed2#.8c7aaatsv)

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

## Installation

Add this to your Cartfile:
`github "gabrieloc/QuadKit"`

To test the examples, make sure [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) is installed, then run:

`carthage update`


## Integration

Ensure any project using this framework includes `QuadKit.framework` and `SwiftSocket.framework` as embedded binaries.

To connect to your quadcopter, create an instance of `QuadClient` and call `-connect:`. Ensure that your device has been connected to the Wi-Fi network created by your quadcopter, before attempting to connect. Once a connection has been established, the client expects to be passed an `InputState` object via `-updateInput:`, in response to user interaction.

### Example

``` Swift

let client = QuadClient()
let inputState = InputState()
let thrustControl = UIControl()

func connectClient() {
	if let error = client.connect() {
		// Error connecting
	}
	thrustControl.enabled = true
}

func thrustControlTouched(_ thrustControl: UIControl) {
	inputState.thrust = thrustControl.selected ? 1.0 : 0.0
	client.updateInput(with inputState)
}
```

iOS and macOS samples can be found inside the `Examples/` directory.


## Contributing

While the format for input data appears to be generic across models (needs to be verified), it's possible that handshake data isn't. For this reason, `BindingSupport` defines a protocol `QuadcopterModel`, which individual models can use for providing this data.

Handshake data can be found by running a tool like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` to get a packet trace, and collecting the first few packets your device sends your quadcopter in the software provided by it's manufacturer.

### Example

1. Connect your device via USB and create a RVI: `$ rvictl -s (DEVICE UDID)`
2. Ensure the remote interface was created by running: `$ ifconfig -l` and verifying `rvi0` exists
3. Turn on your quadcopter and join it's Wi-Fi network
4. In a tool like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org), begin capturing `rvi0`
5. Open the software provided by your quadcopter's manufacturer and access the input controls
6. Stop capturing and find what looks like identification data. It should consistently look the same every time you try to connect the app, and will appear before you begin receiving any form of input or video data
7. Create a new class in `QuadKit` representing your quadcopter model, and have it adopt `QuadcopterModel`
8. In your class' implementation of `-identification`, return the data your recorded in the form of byte arrays
